// this service is gonna be responsible for storage, our messages and channels, and also the functions that will retrieve messages and channels as well as utilities that is needed for this.
// we have now a place to store our channels.
// we need also a function to retrieve those - we need a authorization header and our urls.
// create our function going to have our web request and go and hit the api and bring back oall our channels back

//        do {  // using Json decoder - this is all the Json parsing you will need. It takes your channel model and just cramps everything that comes from the Json decodes it and stuffes it right into whatever variables you have in the message service or in your channel model as long as it matches correctly.
//          self.channels = try JSONDecoder().decode([Channel].self, from: data)
//        } catch let error {
//            debugPrint(Error as Any)
//        }
//        print(self.channels)
